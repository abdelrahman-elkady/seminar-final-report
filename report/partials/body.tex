Topic understanding is processed and evaluated using many methods and techniques. One study to understand topic models is by evaluating and
generating labels for different topic models classified manually or programmatically. In this study, an evaluation of different visual evaluation techniques
for labeling and assessing the correctness of generated labels is conducted. Running over four different visualization techniques, and evaluating them
over two phases, the labeling phase, where users are labeling the topics using the visualization technique. And the validation phase, where users are
measuring and selecting best matching labels from the ones generated in the first phase.
